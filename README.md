The file (AdventureWorks2012.bak)  is available on all data scientist website to test run your ability in writing queries. In this project, I was able to showcase some of my talents in filtering, sorting and writing queries. This repository is focused mainly on the Human Resources.Employees table.
Considering some task, I was able to join, group and filter some tables in the whole queries. Also, some mathematical functions were used in calculating the age, year in service etc
